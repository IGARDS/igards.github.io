## Memberships
We have designed three types of institute memberships for helping companies reach immediate and long term data science and analytics goals. 
Included with each membership and core to our partnership model is the placement of data science teams (M.S. in Data Science and Analytics)
students within your company for up to 7 months as part of their practicum experience. Each of these teams is mentored by a faculty member to
help the both the company and the students maximize the practicum experience. Two examples of past projects completed during a practicum scenario
are building a natural language driven recommendation system and developing deep learning neural networks for market classification. All memberships
provide one of a kind recruitment opportunities and talent development. For more information, please contact Paul Anderson at
