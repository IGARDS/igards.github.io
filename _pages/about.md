The Institute for Graph Analytics and Research in Data Science (IGARDS) began at the College of Charleston. Its first and motivating goal was to bring researchers from computer science, mathematics, and statistics together to complement and enhance their collaborative research efforts into foundational data science problems. It has since grown to include faculty across the United States and international colleagues from Japan.
