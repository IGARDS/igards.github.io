## Paul Anderson, Ph.D.
Associate Professor<br>
Director, Data Science<br>
Department of Computer Science<br>
College of Charleston

<div class="small">
Anderson is the director of the Data Science B.S. and M.S. Program. He is the leader of the Data Science Research Group, which specializes in developing novel algorithms in the fields of foundational data science, data mining, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Anderson's expertise includes machine learning, large-scale distributed computing, evolutionary computation and optimization, and biomedical cyberinfrastructure. He has funded multidisciplinary projects in metabolomics, human cognition and fatigue, toxicology, marine biology, cancer informatics, and medical and marine genomics. To date, Anderson has mentored over 30 undergraduate researchers and 7 graduate students. He is the principal investigator for the Omics NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates: in this role, he oversees the overall team-driven research agenda that includes students from Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, Data Science, and Biology with PIs from multiple institutions (e.g., NOAA, NIST, and the Medical University of South Carolina). Besides these academic roles, Anderson has active industry partnerships with BoomTown ROI (deep learning and NLP), Ceterus (transfer learning), and Bosch.

## Amy Langville, Ph.D.
Professor<br>
Department of Mathematics<br>
College of Charleston

<div class="small">
Langville holds M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Operations Research and is an expert in ranking and optimization models. Her postdoctoral work was in text and data mining, with emphasis on ranking methods for the World Wide Web. She has written two widely read research books on rating and ranking and holds a patent for ranking on social networks. Her papers in this field have won awards, including the top-cited award of the Computational Statistics and Data Analysis journal.
Langville has served as a consultant, scientific expert, or advisory board member in numerous occasions. She has consulted for the NBA, the U.S. Olympic Committee, Rootmetrics, and several high profile court cases, including the patent infringement case Software Rights Archive vs. Google, Yahoo!, Microsoft, and Ask.com, where she investigated the inner workings of the search engines, including their ranking algorithms. Langville has organized conferences (e.g., 2006 Markov Anniversary Meeting and 2009 Southeastern Ranking and Clustering Workshop), and participated in other scientific institutes, in particular SAMSI, playing roles of increasing responsibility from a participant, session organizer, event leader to the outreach education chair.

## Annalisa Calini, Ph.D.
Professor<br>
Department of Mathematics<br>
College of Charleston

<div class="small">
Calini's research employs techniques from dynamical systems, PDEs, geometry, topology, and complex analysis. Her main interests are in integrable and near-integrable nonlinear wave equations, fluid dynamics, differential geometry, and mathematical physics. Her contributions are to topological and geometric aspects of vortex filament dynamics integrable geometric evolution equations; and models of extreme (or rogue) wave formation in deep water. Calini's recent work has focused on dynamical stability---whether certain solutions (such as bound states and equilibria) are robust under perturbations of initial conditions or of the model itself; and on characterizing and predicting rogue waves, including selection criteria for good rogue wave models, modeling rogue waves in realistic sea states, and a statistical predictor tool based on the spectral transform of the underlying integrable PDE. Calini served as an Applied Mathematics program officer at the NSF (2011--2013). As current co-director of the Mathematical Sciences M.S. Program, she helped design and establish its new statistics concentration, and has contributed to developing an interdisciplinary M.S. Data Science Program. Calini has organized many research meetings, including the SEAMS workshop series (a.k.a. Cha-Cha Days, 2004-2010), over a dozen of special sessions, and the 2016 SIAM Conference on Nonlinear Waves and Coherent Structures in capacity of Activity Group Program Director. She directed or co-directed 11 undergraduate research projects, 4 Master's theses, and 1 Ph.D. thesis.

## Garrett Mitchener, Ph.D.
Professor<br>
Department of Mathematics<br>
College of Charleston

<div class="small">
Mitchener has expertise in dynamical systems theory, probability, and discrete mathematics. His primary research area is in applications of mathematics to biology, learning, and linguistics. In addition, he is an experienced software developer. His current projects include a stochastic model of spontaneous language change in an age-structured population, an optimal stopping problem, and an artificial life simulation for studying the evolution of neural networks and communication. He has supervised undergraduate research projects on models of the human visual system, English syntax, the dynamics of semantics, and adapting Scrabble for non-English languages. He is also a co-director of the annual Math Meet, a day-long mathematics contest attracting around 500 high school students to the College of Charleston campus to compete in written tests and quiz-bowl style events.

## Timothy Chartier, Ph.D.
Professor<br>
Mathematics and Computer Science Department<br>
Davidson College

<div class="small">
Chartier is an applied mathematician with a focus in computer science, and frequently works in data analytics with a specialty in sports analytics. He has worked with the NBA, ESPN's Sport Science, NASCAR teams, and fantasy sports sites. Chartier directs and works with a team of about two dozen student researchers to provide analytics to Davidson College sports teams.
